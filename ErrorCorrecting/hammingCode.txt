This is hamming code error detection and correction using EVEN parity
Enter 4 data bits.D4 D3 D2 D1
Enter the value of D4
1
Enter the value of D3
0
Enter the value of D2
1
Enter the value of D1
0
3 parity bits are required for the transmission of data bits.
SENDER:
The data bits entered are: 1 0 1 0
The Parity bits are:
Value of P3 is 0
Value of P2 is 1
Value of P1 is 0
The Hamming code is as follows :-
D4 D3 D2 P3 D1 P2 P1
1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Enter the hamming code with error at any position of your choice.
NOTE: ENTER A SPACE AFTER EVERY BIT POSITION.
Error should be present only at one bit position
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
RECEIVER:
Error is detected at position 3 at the receiving end.
Correcting the error....
The correct code is 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
